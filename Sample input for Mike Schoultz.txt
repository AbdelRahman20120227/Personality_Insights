There are certainly more than one. Here are the ones I remind myself of often:

You can’t predict the future … so why think that you can.

You won’t please everyone … don’t worry about those you don’t.

Not everyone you meet … is going to like you.

Only YOU … control your destiny. Take initiative on your own behalf.

It is not always worth it … to get the last word.

Listen … before speaking and listen more than you speak.

Don’t waste your energy … on negative people or situations.

You can only help people … who want to be helped.

Appreciate and respect … differences in others.

And most important … just breathe.

How can I become the most knowledgeable and creative person?
Mike Schoultz
Mike Schoultz, Innovation strategist focused on creative development process.
Answered Tue

Probably too many ways to count. Here are a few of my favorites:

Consider different perspectives

Truly intelligent people have the ability to inhabit a different perspective, especially a perspective they disagree with. Abraham Lincoln would sometimes argue with a friend from one perspective, and then they would switch and argue from the opposite perspective.

Continuous learners

They read a lot and are constantly still learning. My father always took us to historical places or natural wonders during our summer vacations. Battlefields. Museums. Grand Canyon. Stuff like that. Our pleas to go to Disneyland went unheard. My father wanted to learn things on his days off—and his days on too. He not only read both fiction and nonfiction, but he also watched many documentaries.

Be consistently curious

Always ask lots of questions. Realize that the way you learn things is often to ask.

Observe with all senses

Truly creative people have developed their ability to observe and to use all of their senses, which can get dull over time. Take time to "sharpen the blade" and take everything in. Add thoughts as you go.

Defer judgment

Your perceptions may limit your reasoning. Be careful about how you perceive things. In other words, defer judgment. Let it all hang out.

Widen your experiences

Experience as much as you can. Exposure puts more ideas into your subconscious. Actively seek out new and very different experiences to broaden your idea thinking experience portfolio.

Observation is a key element in Da Vinci’s creative thinking methods. In order to explore new patterns and find solutions in unrelated elements in nature which are around, the team should be able to observe other designs and problems in order to inspire creative solutions for the existing problem. The examples above started with observing specific actions or objects and use inherent, as well as external ideas surrounding this object to solve the existing problem.

One of the examples of using observation in reaching new ideas is Archimedes in the bathtub. He noticed that once he got into the tub, the level of the water had risen. This observation enabled him to calculate the density of the gold used in the King Hiero II crown, the golden wreath.

Here are my interests in little things in life you should never lose sight of or ever stop learning about:

Have balance

Try many new and different hobbies. Keep the ones you like to further develop through the years. Work hard on maintaining balance in your life. Unplug sometimes and pay attention to your family, which is, let’s be honest, our motivation for working so hard to begin with.

Talk to at least one stranger every day

Strangers are always a hidden opportunity. Opportunities to make a new friend, to get new ideas, to get rid of that fear of talking to strangers, to start a business venture, and much more. Expand the diversity of your network as much as you can.

Mind your relationships

Your relationships can get youth rough anything. No matter how well connected we are, it’s the personal, meaningful relationships that will get you through. And by personal I mean more than just a Facebook post or a like. I mean, covering the distance with phone calls or video chats. Whether it’s finding new content to curate or making sense of a data trend, your relationships will matter much more than the data. All of the success in the world is meaningless if we forget to have our priorities in order.

Manage time well

Life is composed of days, days of hours, hours of minutes. And you only get one lifetime. Make the most of the now.

Find happiness

Be constantly aware of your surroundings and breathe in the beauty around you.

Avoid the putting off of things until later. Instead of waiting to later at some hazy time in the future, find a way to do what you like today.

Be kind to people

Kindness means you are concerned about other people. Kind people think about another person’s feelings and not just their own. They are always looking for ways to help people in need. It’s a little facile, maybe, and certainly hard to implement, but I’d say, as a goal in life, you could do worse than Try to be kinder.

Diversify your life

The breath of your life experiences is a huge advantage. The more different your life experiences, the more creative your ideas and the better you can relate to people.

Being human

There are only so many hours in the day. We can get caught up in the 24/7 social cycle for our clients and think we have to be married to our computers and mobile devices. There are times, in the middle of a big project for a million dollar deal that we have to stay alert, but most of the time, a tweet can wait, that post can be written tomorrow. Unplug sometimes and pay attention to your family, which is, let’s be honest, our motivation for working so hard to begin with.

Get to know different people

If you're a liberal, make friends with conservatives. If you're part of Occupy Wall Street, befriend a banker. If you're a city mouse, get to know a country mouse. Why? Many reasons, one of them being that we make better decisions in diverse surroundings.

Break goals into small objectives

Read a book a week, play catch with your son, go to the gym for a workout twice a week. Break gigantic projects into day-sized tasks. They are much easier to accomplish this way.

Be adaptable

Don’t be afraid to adapt or make changes. Adjustments will always be necessary; sometimes on the fly and some will require much more thought and time.

Remember … we can’t forget to learn the little things as we stretch and grow. If we maintain our balance, being able to stay focused on what keeps us grounded in reality, not being afraid to fail, it will help us be more effective people… emphasis on people.

What was it like learning to work hard after 30?
Mike Schoultz
Mike Schoultz, Working on my third career over 49 years.
Answered Sun

Why wait to you are 30? You can learn anything, anytime. Here are some things I suggest to focus on:

Hustle is the flipside to fear

Still, need more encouragement to go out there and make it happen? Take a note from this quote from Richard Branson – “If somebody offers you an amazing opportunity, but you are not sure you can do it, say yes – then learn how to do it later!”

Stop fearing. Start doing.

Make yourself a project

Hairdressing icon Vidal Sassoon was famous for having said: “The only place you’ll find success coming before work is in a dictionary.” We have to work on ourselves. Put pressure on ourselves. Critique our days. Give back to society. Be our own very best coaches and cheering squads. All of this applies as much to our personal lives as for our business lives.

Happiness is a state of mind, not a destination

Looking back on my life, the unhappiest moments of my life occurred when I always thought I had to achieve a certain goal to be happy. That’s not the way happiness works. You can be happy right now. Be happy that you’re alive. You’re breathing. You’re here in this incredible moment that we call life. That gives you all the reasons you need to be happy.

If I could turn back the clock 5o+ years, here are the topics I would focus on learning well:

Think different … try and explore new ideas without bringing your old ideas along for the ride. Never reject ideas just because you will not agree with them. Examine and study thoughts before setting them aside. Stand out to be heard.

Have fun … remember your learning won’t all come from your books and professors. You will constantly need to remind yourself about the importance of having a good balance in your life.

Practice the art of asking good questions … I know, I know, you thought the tough act was getting the answers nailed. Yes, that is difficult. But asking the really good questions is more important. It starts with being a good listener.

Be curious about everything … this is where the good questions are needed. This is also a key source for your learning.

Learn how to learn … note, in all likelihood, most of you have not mastered this one yet. And when you think you have it down, new technology will come along to add access to more information. None-the-less, you will spend your life on this one, so you might as well start as soon as possible.

Be a never-ending reader of lots of new things … always trying something new. Get your mind exploring, reading will be an important source of your lifetime learning.

And don’t forget this one: Learning about Ourselves ... Check Out These 9 Ultimate Secrets

Develop a strong imagination … dream (yes even daydream … they are the best kind of dreams) … dreams will help you find what you love.

Wear your enthusiasm and passion … show how you feel. Your attitude and emotions are the first signs to others of who you really are and how you are made.
